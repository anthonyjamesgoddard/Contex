I'm nervous as hell as I drive up to your home. Thirty
miles of freeways to think about meeting a stranger, a description
in a computer, a fantasy - what will it be like in person?  It's
still light enough to follow the directions, leading further from
the city into relatively rural hills, with homes not too close to
each other so as to invade privacy.
