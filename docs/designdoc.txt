Next task is to write a proper window analysis.

We can follow count based methods from these slides :
https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures/blob/master/Lecture%202a-%20Word%20Level%20Semantics.pdf

The simplest way:

    + Collection of context words
    + word window size
    + Count the basis words occuring w words to the left or right 
      of each target word in the corpus.

    + Form a vector representation of the target word based on
      these counts.


For instance if we had a target word "kitten" and a window size of 2 with context words
["cute", "fluffy", "furry"].

Then in the text we have 

... the fluffy kitten ...
... the cute kitten ...


Then the vector representation of the target word with respect to the context basis is 

kitten = [1,1,0].
